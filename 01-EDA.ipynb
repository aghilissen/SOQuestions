    "# Text Data Exploration\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "For this article, I wanted to cover a few key concepts unique to handling text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say unique to NLP because unlike the pre-processing of visual or audio data, the pre-processing of text data requires a few more steps. Even if the data is valid (by valid, I mean text, characters), it might not be in the language you understand (i.e. English), it might not be in Latin alphabet or, it might not be in the right encoding format (in `UTF-8` for example). If you are dealing with web scrapped data, most of the time you'll encounter `<html>` or other formatting tags that will need to be dealt with as they are not part of the content *per se*. Not to say this information is not relevant, it can reveal useful patterns, but if treated like any other word, it will most likely generate noise. So it is important to pick those up early enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, one of the solutions for this kind of data processing is Regular Expressions or `regex`... I will try and avoid this as much as possible as it hurts my brain but, I have to admit there are a few, easy to remember, patterns that will help greatly during the cleaning process and also during the tokenization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "Before we start, let's talk about the lingo:\n",
    "- Corpus - It is a collection of (similar) documents.\n",
    "- Document - It is a collection of sentences that have the same context. It can be a review, a paragraph, a log file, etc.\n",
    "- NLP - Natural Language Processing. It is an area of AI which deals with interpreting human language. In our context, it refers to the analysis of text data by a computer.\n",
    "- NLTK - Natural Language Tool Kit. It is a very powerful library for NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset\n",
    "To support this article, I am going to use a dataset from Kaggle: [60k Stack Overflow Questions with Quality Rating](https://www.kaggle.com/imoore/60k-stack-overflow-questions-with-quality-rate). Ultimately I'll probably try to classify them but, as I found this dataset today, it is exploration time! ![Put your hat on!](./img/Indi.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset covers 60,000 questions asked on [StackOveflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) between 2016 and 2020. To link this back to the lingo, this is our corpus, and a specific question is going to be called a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the [`Tasks`](https://www.kaggle.com/imoore/60k-stack-overflow-questions-with-quality-rate/tasks?taskId=1889) tab, we are challenged to classify SO questions based on the text quality, with a hint about the last column being added to ease a supervised classification.\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "It comes as a file named `data.csv` containing 60,000 rows and 5 columns (+ 1 `Id` column which will be our index). When displayed, it looks like this:"
